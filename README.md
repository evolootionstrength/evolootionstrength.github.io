# Personal Data
We collect and store personal information related to your App profile, which you voluntarily give us either upon sign-up or through continued use of the App:
- Email address
- Workout data
We may also collect billing information, such as credit card number, when purchasing a subscription to the App. We do not store this information.

# How We Collect Data
We may collect the data detailed above in two different ways:
- When you voluntarily provide us with such data - meaning, for example, if you create an account with our App or enter data related to your workouts.
- Data collected automatically - meaning, information related to your device, such as hardware and geographic location.

# How We Use Your Data
We use your email address to enable you to login to the App, to verify your subscription status with the App, and to access your workout data.

# Retention of Your Data
Once you are a registered user of the App, we retain your data for as long as you remain an active user of your account. When there has not been any activity on your account for three years, we will contact you to check if you still wish to retain your account with us. When you decide to cancel your account or we do not hear further from you, your account will be de-activated and all your data will be deleted. 

If you would like to request that we delete your account and/or data, please contact us at evolootionllc@gmail.com with the subject line “Delete user data”.
